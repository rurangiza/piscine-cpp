This book was written for readers interested in learning the C++ programming
language from scratch, and for both novice and advanced C++ programmers wishing
to enhance their knowledge of C++. It was our goal from the begining to
design this text with the capabilities of serving dual markets, as a text- book
for students and as a holistic reference manual for professionals.
